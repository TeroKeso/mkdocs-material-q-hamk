## 3. Requirements
### 3.1 Requirements definition
Make BYOD page better  
Details in 4. Goals below
### 3.2 Input pages
The <a href='https://hamk-business-information-technology.github.io/os/' target='_blank'>current BYOD page</a> and all of its subpages.

## 4. Goals = be better than moodle
### ✓ 4.1 Search
Integrated
### ✓ 4.2 Easy to use code copy and paste
Integrated.  
#### Bugs and fixes  
Code block with ```: blank lines automatically added after each line when copied (Some bugs at 9.5.18 fixed at 9.5.22)  
- bug said fixed (<a href='https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/commit/34d789bf8223af143a73d1890aa75a1d5005e3f8' target='_blank'>9.5.21</a>) but problem persisting despite latest mkdocs and mkdocs-material update and rebuild -clean  
- this may not be related to <a href='https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/3360' target='_blank'>highlighting specific lines adds blank lines when copying</a>   
- safe net <a href='https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/7076' target='_blank'>1.5.3</a>  
- done <a href='https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/7170' target='_blank'>/issues/7170</a> then 9.5.22 released  
### ✓ 4.3 Code line numbering
Done, only needs some css tuning.  
Two ways of writing code blocks (recommended to use ``` since we don't have to type 4 indents in each line).  
### ✓ 4.4. Dark mode as default
To set dark mode as default:  
put - scheme: slate as the 1st scheme in palette  
 
### ... 4.5 Code highlight
✓ Done: python, java, js, html, powershell  
 (even done, need checking and improving if needed)  
... Suboptimal: php (need the leading '<?php')  
... Suboptimal: bash, sh  

### 4.6 Code annotation
<a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#code-annotations'>mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#code-annotations</a>

### 4.7 Integration to videoplatform   
<a href='https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/3984' target='_blank'>discussions/3984</a>  

## 5. Fantasy
### 5.1 VM inside of browser
### 5.2 Integration on VM


## 6. Tech notes
#### 6.1 CSS: 
Central CSS (root):  
site\assets\stylesheets (govern light and dark mode)  
Custom CSS (custom.css)  

#### 6.2 Branding items
Logo (path: )  
Favicon (path: )  
#### 6.3 Code block with ``` better supported than by indentation
**HAMK colors:**   
rgb(0, 55, 85) to hex = #003755  
rgb(238, 238, 238) #EEEEEE  
<a href='https://www.hamk.fi/wp-content/themes/hamk/dist/graphic-background-full.svg?v=081d95ef6e7655f27b90'>HAMK colors</a>

####

markdown_extensions: 
  - pymdownx.highlight:
    anchor_linenums: true
  - pymdownx.inlinhilite
  - pymdownx.snipets

## 7. Curiosity and Ideas
### Always test, Do not assume
### 7.1 Mobile friendliness lost with code line numbering (4 indents - codehilite: linenums: true, and css)
#### No problem if code block generated by ```
Original sites with code blocks (no line numbering) are mobile friendly <a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/' target='_blank'>MkDocs-material References</a> or <a href='https://luonghuyquang.github.io/mkdocs-material-q-hamk/' target='_blank'>Initial experiment</a>  
### 7.2 Nav and TOC
#### Submenu:  
BYOD (as small page): doesn't need  
Other (larger) webservers: yes  
#### Left panel for navigating between subpages, right panel for current page TOC:  
Documentation <a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#table-of-contents'>#table-of-contents</a>. Examples:  
- <a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/contributing' target='_blank'>mkdocs-material community</a>  
- <a href='https://blog.pypi.org/' target='_blank'>pypi blog</a>  
#### To navigate among subpages:  
- anchoring  
- floating  
- simple home logo to click on  

### 7.3 Analytics & SEO (!!! GDPR, not prioritized)
Analytic tools, number of users, time of use, heatmap etc.  
(Moodle has its activity tracker)  
Indexed by SEs such as Google  

### 7.4 Switch to 'system preference' beside the dual dark / light
Example  
- <a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/' target='_blank'>material for MkDocs</a>
